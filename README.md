###### Hyderabad museum is my favourite place 

There are many spots in that museum where we can find most **interest facts** about the city. 

we can see the **potraits** of the __kings__ who ruled this city in the __early times__. we can also find the things used by them.

# Specifing the airport 

The nearest airport for the museum is Rajiv Gandhi International aiport.<br>
After coming out from the airport, there will be cabs available. we can book a cab <br>
They will drop you at the museum. It is just a 20 minutes travel time for us to go to the museum.
